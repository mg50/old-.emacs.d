  <h3>PROMISE TO PAY AND CALCULATION OF INTEREST</h3>
  <p> You promise to pay us <%= amount_given_directly_to_account_holder %> (the amount of the principal) plus interest from the Disbursement Date of this
      Agreement until the final installment due date ("Maturity Date") set forth in the payment schedule above ("Payment Schedule"), or any adjusted payment
      schedule subsequently agreed to by the parties. Interest will accrue beginning on the Disbursement Date even if the funds from this Agreement are
      provided to you earlier. You also promise to pay any other charges provided for under this Agreement. The Finance Charge disclosure above represents
      the amount of interest you will pay under this Agreement assuming you pay all your scheduled installment payments when due according to the Payment Schedule.
      You promise to pay us by <%= official_payment_type_name %> the amounts scheduled on the dates set forth in the Payment Schedule,
      or any adjusted payment schedule agreed to by the parties. Time is of the essence. We charge interest under an adjusted daily simple interest method at
      the annual rate of <%= loan_interest_rate_percent %> ("Contract Rate"). Interest shall not be payable in advance or compounded. We apply the Contract Rate to the
      "Adjusted Principal Balance" from the Disbursement Date until the earlier of (i) the Maturity Date, (ii) prepayment in full, or (iii)
      acceleration pursuant to the default provisions. The term "Adjusted Principal Balance" (hereinafter the "APB") means the loan principal balance
      that would be outstanding assuming you make each payment timely, less any additional prepayments of principal. "Timely" means making payment in
      accordance with the Payment Schedule or any adjusted payment schedule agreed to by the parties. The APB will equal the outstanding loan principal
      balance if you make all payments timely and no other payments. You will never be required to pay more total interest than the amount set forth in the
      Finance Charge above.
  </p>

  <h3>LATE CHARGE</h3>
  <p>If you are 10 days or more late on an installment payment, you may be charged a late fee of $30 or 5% of the unpaid installment payment, whichever amount is greater.</p>

  <h3>RETURNED PAYMENT CHARGE</h3>
  <p> You agree to pay a service charge of $ 20 if any payment instrument is dishonored in accordance with Utah Code Ann. &sect; 7-15-1. If the payment instrument is
      dishonored, we may: (i) give written or oral notice of dishonor to you; and (ii) waive all or part of the $20 service charge. If the payment instrument
      is dishonored we will not collect and you will not be liable for the $20 service charge, if we redeposit the payment instrument and it is honored.
  </p>


  <h3>RESCISSION and PREPAYMENT</h3>
  <p> You shall have the right to make payment in advance and in any amount on this Agreement at any time. You will not incur an additional charge,
      fee or penalty for prepayment. Prepayments of principal may reduce the total amount of interest you are scheduled to pay under this Agreement.
      To rescind future payment obligations under this Agreement and receive a refund of the finance charge, you must (i) inform us in writing via fax
      (<%= our_fax_number %>) or email (<a href="mailto:<%= our_support_email_address %>"><%= our_support_email_address %></a>) of your intent to rescind
      no later than 6:00 PM Eastern Time on the next business day immediately following the Disbursement Date ("Rescission Deadline"), and (ii) give us
      written authorization to effect a debit entry to Your Bank Account, defined in the Repayment Authorization below, for the principal amount of the loan.
      If we receive payment of the principal amount of the loan via the authorization, then we will refund the interest owing and rescind the future payment
      obligations under this Agreement. <%= recision_and_prepayment_by_repayment_method %>
  </p>

  <h3>APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS</h3>
  <p> Payment will be applied first to satisfy any past due amounts owing, and then to any currently scheduled installment amounts owing.
      If you are past due, we credit all payments received first to the oldest past due amounts owing by applying such to any late charges,
      returned payment charge, then to accumulated but unpaid interest, and then to past due principal owing. We repeat the process until
      all past due amounts have been paid in full. If you are not past due, we credit all payments to the current or upcoming scheduled
      installment by applying such to interest, and then to principal as of the date received. If an early payment is less than the scheduled
      installment, then you must pay the difference on or before the upcoming installment due date. Early payments, which equal or exceed a
      scheduled installment, will satisfy the upcoming installment. Excess payments received on a scheduled installment due date will be
      credited to any accrued and outstanding interest, then principal, and not credited to upcoming installments. Therefore, you must pay
      the next installment as scheduled. Payment of principal may reduce (i) total amount of interest you are scheduled to pay under this
      Agreement, (ii) the number of payments, and/or (iii) the final payment.

    <h3>Range of Varying Amounts.</h3>
    <p> Please note that you have the right to receive notice of all transfers varying in amount, and that by signing this <%= ach_or_rcc %> Authorization you acknowledge that we have elected to offer you a

    <p> Arbitration is a process in which persons with a dispute(s): (a) agree to submit their dispute(s) to a neutral third person (an "arbitrator") for a decision; and (b) waive their rights to file a
        lawsuit in court to resolve their dispute(s). Each party to the dispute(s) has an opportunity to present some evidence to the arbitrator. Pre-arbitration discovery may be limited. Arbitration
        proceedings are private and less formal than court trials. The arbitrator will issue a final and binding decision resolving the dispute(s), which may be enforced as a court judgment. A court

      <li>YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A COURT, OTHER THAN A COURT OF LIMITED JURISDICTION (e.g., small claims court), RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE ALLEGED AGAINST US OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES; and </li>
      <li>YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, AND/OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS,
          IN ANY LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST US AND/OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>No Class Arbitration.</h4>
    <p><strong>Except as provided in the Small Claim Disputes paragraph below, all disputes, including any Representative Claims against us and/or related third parties shall be resolved by binding arbitration
        only on an individual basis with you. THEREFORE, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT CONDUCT CLASS ARBITRATION. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL ALSO NOT ALLOW YOU TO SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL,
        OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY FOR OTHERS IN THE ARBITRATION.</strong>
    </p>

    <h4>Process.</h4>
    <p> Any party to a dispute, including related third parties, may send the other party written notice by certified mail return receipt requested of their intent to arbitrate and setting forth the subject
        of the dispute along with the relief requested, even if a lawsuit has been filed. Regardless of who demands arbitration, you shall have the right to select either of the following arbitration
        organizations to administer the arbitration: the American Arbitration Association (1-800-778-7879) <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank">http://www.adr.org</a> or JAMS (1-800-352-5267)
        <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com" target="_blank">http://www.jamsadr.com</a>. However, the parties may agree
        to select a local arbitrator who is an attorney, retired judge, or arbitrator registered and in good standing with an arbitration association and arbitrate pursuant to the arbitrator's rules.
        If you demand arbitration, you must inform us in your demand of the arbitration organization you have selected or whether you desire to select a local arbitrator. If related third parties or we
        demand arbitration, you must notify us within 20 days in writing by certified mail return receipt requested of your decision to select an arbitration organization or your desire to select a local
        arbitrator. If you fail to notify us, then we have the right to select an arbitration organization. The parties to the dispute will be governed by the rules and procedures of the arbitration organization
        applicable to consumer disputes, to the extent those rules and procedures do not contradict the express terms of this Agreement, including the Arbitration Provision. You may get a copy of the rules and
        procedures by contacting the arbitration organization listed above.
    </p>

    <h4>Fees/Awards/Appeals.</h4>
    <p> Regardless of who demands arbitration, we will advance your portion of the expenses associated with the arbitration, including the filing, administrative, hearing and arbitrator's fees ("Arbitration Fees").
        Throughout the arbitration, each party shall bear his or her own attorneys' fees and expenses, such as witness and expert witness fees. The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law consistent with
        the FAA, and applicable statutes of limitation, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. The arbitration hearing will be conducted in the county of your residence, in the county where this
        Agreement was signed, or in such other place as ordered by the arbitrator or required by law. The arbitrator may decide, with or without a hearing, any motion that is substantially similar to a motion to
        dismiss for failure to state a claim or a motion for summary judgment. In conducting the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure or evidence.
        If allowed by statute or applicable law, the arbitrator may award statutory damages and/or reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. If the arbitrator renders a decision in your favor awarding monetary
        damages and the award is less than the maximum amount allowed to be awarded in the state's court of limited jurisdiction, then your award will be automatically increased to $100 more than that maximum amount.
        Regardless of whether the arbitrator renders a decision or an award in your favor resolving the dispute, you will not be responsible for reimbursing us for your portion of the Arbitration Fees. At the timely
        request of any party, the arbitrator shall provide a written explanation for the award. The arbitrator's award may be filed with any court having jurisdiction. Either party may appeal the arbitrator's
        decision within 30 days to a single arbitrator or a three-arbitrator panel from the same arbitration organization originally chosen, which shall review the award de novo (without regard to the original
        decision). If you decide to appeal the decision to a single arbitrator, then we will pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees associated with the appeal. If you decide to appeal the decision to a
        three-arbitrator panel, then you will be responsible for paying the difference in Arbitration Fees between a single arbitrator and a three- arbitrator panel.
    </p>

    <h4>Small Claim Disputes.</h4>
    <p> All parties, including related third parties, shall retain the right to seek adjudication in the state's court of limited jurisdiction for disputes within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.
        Any dispute, which cannot be adjudicated in that court, shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Any appeal of a judgment from that court shall be resolved by binding arbitration.
    </p>

    <h4>Interstate Commerce.</h4>
    <p> This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the FAA. If a final non-appealable judgment of a court having jurisdiction over this transaction
        finds, for any reason, that the FAA does not apply to this transaction, then our agreement to arbitrate shall be governed by the arbitration law of the State of Utah.
    </p>

    <h4>Binding Effect.</h4>
    <p> This Arbitration Provision is binding upon and benefits you, your respective heirs, successors and assigns. The Arbitration Provision is binding upon and benefits us, our successors and assigns, and
        related third parties. The Arbitration Provision continues in full force and effect, even if your obligations have been prepaid, paid or discharged through bankruptcy. The Arbitration Provision survives
        any termination, amendment, expiration or performance of any transaction between you and us and continues in full force and effect unless you and we otherwise agree in writing.
    </p>

    <h4>Severability.</h4>
    <p> If any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of the Arbitration Provision, unless the provision precluding the arbitrator
        from conducting a class arbitration as set forth in the No Class Arbitration paragraph is deemed invalid or unenforceable, in which case this entire Arbitration Provision shall be deemed void.
    </p>

      <h3>OPT-OUT PROCESS.</h3>
      <p> You may choose to opt out of this Arbitration Provision but only by following the process set forth below. If you do not wish to be subject to this Arbitration Provision, then you must notify
          us in writing postmarked within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of this Agreement at the following address: <%= nc_financial_solutions_address %>.
          Your written notice must include your name, address, social security number, the date of this Agreement, a statement that you wish to opt out of
          the Arbitration Provision and must not be sent with any other correspondence. Indicating your desire to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision in any manner other than as provided above is
          insufficient notice. Your decision to opt out of this Arbitration Provision will not affect your other rights or responsibilities under this Agreement, and applies only to this Arbitration
          Provision and no prior or subsequent Arbitration Provision to which you and we have agreed.
